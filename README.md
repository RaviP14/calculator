 ## Calculator Project ##

 In this project I use Javascript, HTML and CSS to create an on-screen calculator.

 The **Live preview** of this project is available <a href="https://ravip14.github.io/calculator/">here</a>.

 #### Features: ####

- The calculations supported are: **add**, **subtract**, **multiply**, **divide**, **power** and **percentage**. 
- These calculations are **rounded** to three decimal places.
- A **decimal button** has been added - only for use once for each number & only on values in the calculation.
- A **backspace button** has been added which removes one number at a time. 
- A **clear button** has been added to clear the display & all values at once.
- If the user decides to divide by 0 a **funny message** is displayed.
- **Keyboard support** has been added.
- Operation buttons are (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, `=`, `%`), the (`backspace`) button and the (`delete`) button to clear the screen.
- The decimal button (`.`) is prevented from being pressed twice.
